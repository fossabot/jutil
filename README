JUTIL
~~~~~~

This package of python utilities is designed to facilitate the solving of medium-sized 
ill-posed problems by means of iterative techniques.

An example of how to use it is given in scripts/example.py. The use of further functions
can be derived from the testcases.

Please contact j.ungermann@fz-juelich.de if you require assistance.
